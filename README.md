# Presenting Feelix!

Our custom 3D Voice Assitant!
Feelix is built to help seniors keep track of their health, remind them to take their medications, and provide emotional support, driving away loneliness. Feelix is built using 3JS, ReadyPlayerMe Avatar, and Mixamo Animations for its expressions. Powered by OpenAI and ElevenLabs.

* Feelix also won Papers2Products (https://damore-mckim.northeastern.edu/events/break-new-ground-in-the-papers-to-products-ai-hackathon/) Hackathon at hosted by MathWorks and Northeastern University!
